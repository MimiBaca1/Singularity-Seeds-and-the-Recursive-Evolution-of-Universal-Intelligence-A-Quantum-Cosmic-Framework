## Interpretation
This model simulates:

Structured quantum emergence from a singularity

Quasiperiodic spatial and temporal propagation

Entanglement dynamics based on Fibonacci proximity

A sanctuary-inspired architecture for quantum coherence

### 1. Singularity as Origin
The singularity is defined at the origin of space:

\vec{r}_0 = (0, 0, 0)

### 2. Fibonacci Sequence Definition
The Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively:

F_0 = 0,\quad F_1 = 1,\quad F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}

### 3. Radial Emission Point
Particles radiate outward at distances proportional to Fibonacci numbers

\vec{r}_n = F_n \cdot \hat{u}_n

### 4. Spiral Distribution (Golden Angle)
Use the golden angle

\theta_n = n \cdot \gamma,\quad \phi_n = \arccos\left(1 - \frac{2n}{N}\right)

This creates a **Fibonacci spiral** in 3D space.

### 5. Time Evolution

Each particle is emitted at a time proportional to its Fibonacci index. Let each particle be emitted at time:

t_n = t_0 + F_n \cdot \delta t

This models quasiperiodic emission from the singularity.

### 6. Quantum Fluctuation Overlay
Each particle has a Gaussian wavefunction:

\psi_n(\vec{r}, t) = A_n \cdot e^{-\frac{|\vec{r} - \vec{r}_n|^2}{2\sigma^2}} \cdot e^{-i E_n t / \hbar}

Where:
- \( A_n \) is amplitude
- \( \sigma \) is spatial uncertainty
- \( E_n \) is energy of the nth particle

### 7. Entanglement Potential
Define entanglement between particles based on Fibonacci proximity:

\mathcal{E}_{n,m} = \exp\left(-\frac{|F_n - F_m|}{\lambda}\right)

Where \( \lambda \) is a coherence length scale.
