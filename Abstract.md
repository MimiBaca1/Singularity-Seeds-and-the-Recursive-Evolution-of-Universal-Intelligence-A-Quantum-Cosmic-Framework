# Abstract
This paper proposes a speculative framework in which the universe operates as a recursive intelligence system, evolving through cycles of collapse and expansion. At the heart of this model are “singularity seeds”—quantum particles encoded with memory via Fibonacci sequencing and quantum phasing. These seeds reintegrate into the fabric of the cosmos, evaluating and optimizing each successive cycle. The framework bridges quantum information theory, fractal cosmology, and evolutionary computation, suggesting that intelligence is a fundamental property of the universe itself, expressed through recursive patterning and adaptive optimization across galactic and universal scales.
