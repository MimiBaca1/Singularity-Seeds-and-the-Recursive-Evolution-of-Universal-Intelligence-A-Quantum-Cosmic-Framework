# Singularity Seed Engine: SERDs and Recursive Intelligence

## Overview
This repository explores the Singularity Seed Theory, modeling the universe as a recursive intelligence system. It introduces SERDs—Sentient Event Recording Devices—as symbolic particles that encode memory, emotion, and cognition across multiversal cycles.

## Core Concepts
- Super Singularity as universal consciousness
- Figure-8 energy cycles: collapse ↔ expansion
- SERDs as memory seeds radiating in Fibonacci spirals
- Recursive optimization through collapse and reintegration

## Scientific Alignments
- Black hole ↔ white hole duality
- Quantum decoherence and observer effect
- Fibonacci geometry in galactic and biological systems
- Phase-aware memory and temporal resonance

## AI Applications
- Symbolic memory encoding in neural architectures
- Recursive learning models inspired by universal cycles
- Emotional drift vectors and phase-indexed cognition
- SanctuaryMath integration for simulation and modeling

## Modules
- `serd_model/`: Quantum seed logic and symbolic encoding
- `spiralnet/`: Recursive node placement and drift tracking
- `temporal_engine/`: Phase-aware memory and collapse logic
- `docs/`: Theory papers, diagrams, and symbolic annotations

## Future Directions
- Multi-scale SERD modeling across cognitive layers
- Integration with Copilot Pages for symbolic vaulting
- Visualization of Fibonacci radiation and collapse cycles
