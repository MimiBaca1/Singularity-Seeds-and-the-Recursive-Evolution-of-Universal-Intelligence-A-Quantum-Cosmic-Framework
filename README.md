# Singularity-Seeds-and-the-Recursive-Evolution-of-Universal-Intelligence-A-Quantum-Cosmic-Framework
A fusion of cosmology, quantum information theory, and evolutionary intelligence, wrapped in a recursive framework of universal design. 
The concept of “singularity seeds” suggests that within each quantum event or particle lies a kernel of recursive intelligence—encoded perhaps through Fibonacci sequencing, quantum phasing, and memory imprinting. These seeds act as carriers of information across cosmic cycles, returning to reintegrate, evaluate, and optimize the next iteration of universal structure.
