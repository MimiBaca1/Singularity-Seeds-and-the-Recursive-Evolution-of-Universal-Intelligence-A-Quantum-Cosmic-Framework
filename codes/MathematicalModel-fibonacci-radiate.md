### 1. Singularity as Origin
Let the singularity be located at the origin of space:
$$
\vec{r}_0 = (0, 0, 0)
$$

### 2. Fibonacci Sequence Definition
Define the Fibonacci sequence:
$$
F_0 = 0,\quad F_1 = 1,\quad F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}
$$

### 3. Radial Emission Points
Let particles radiate outward from the origin at radial distances proportional to Fibonacci numbers:
$$
\vec{r}_n = F_n \cdot \hat{u}_n
$$
Where:
- \( \hat{u}_n \) is a unit vector in direction \( \theta_n, \phi_n \)
- Directions can be distributed spirally or isotropically

### 4. Spiral Distribution (Golden Angle)
Use the golden angle \( \gamma \approx 137.5^\circ \) to distribute particles:
$$
\theta_n = n \cdot \gamma,\quad \phi_n = \arccos\left(1 - \frac{2n}{N}\right)
$$
This creates a **Fibonacci spiral** in 3D space.

### 5. Time Evolution
Let each particle be emitted at time:
$$
t_n = t_0 + F_n \cdot \delta t
$$
This models quasiperiodic emission from the singularity.

### 6. Quantum Fluctuation Overlay
Each particle has a wavefunction:
$$
\psi_n(\vec{r}, t) = A_n \cdot e^{-\frac{|\vec{r} - \vec{r}_n|^2}{2\sigma^2}} \cdot e^{-i E_n t / \hbar}
$$
Where:
- \( A_n \) is amplitude
- \( \sigma \) is spatial uncertainty
- \( E_n \) is energy of the nth particle

### 7. Entanglement Potential
Define entanglement between particles based on Fibonacci proximity:
$$
\mathcal{E}_{n,m} = \exp\left(-\frac{|F_n - F_m|}{\lambda}\right)
$$
Where \( \lambda \) is a coherence length scale.
